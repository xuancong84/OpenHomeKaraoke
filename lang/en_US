A semitone is also known as a half-step. It is the smallest interval used in classical Western music, equal to a twelfth of an octave or half a tone.
DNN-based vocal splitter is enabled. OpenHomeKaraoke uses PyTorch (by Facebook) to run a deep neural network to split instrumental and vocal sound in each track giving rise to stereo sound.

Vocal Splitter
Youtube-dl (yt-dlp) version
OpenHomeKaraoke version
Advanced Control Options
Vocal splitter mode:
Use L-R/L+R
Use DNN
Standard MTV audio has the two stereo channels (L and R) encoded in such a way that: L-R is the instrument track, L+R is the vocal track. Thus, by simply subtracting or adding the two stereo channels, we can get the instrumental and vocal track in mono sound. OpenHomeKaraoke's built-in DNN-based (deep neural network) vocal splitter uses AI algorithm to split instrumental and vocal sound in each stereo track independently resulting in stereo instrumental and vocal tracks.
Stop Splitter
Restart Splitter
The vocal splitter (that supports both DNN-based and stereo subtraction) runs as a separate process in the background, generating instrumental/vocal audio file for every song.
Re-synchronize audio and video:
Stop Streamer
Restart Streamer
This only affects playing KTV via web browser. Restarting the screen-capture-and-streaming improves audio/video synchronization, it also decreases the latency between the server and browser.
Refresh the song list:
Rescan song directory
You should only need to do this if you manually copied files to the download directory while OpenHomeKaraoke was running.
Updates
If downloads or searches stopped working, updating youtube-dl will probably fix it. The current installed version is:
Update youtube-dl
This update link above may fail if you don't have proper file permissions. Check the OpenHomeKaraoke log for errors.
Shutdown
Don't just pull the plug! Always shut down your server properly to avoid data corruption.

Expand Raspberry Pi filesystem
If you just installed the pre-built OpenHomeKaraoke pi image and your SD card is larger than 4GB, you may want to expand the filesystem to utilize the remaining space. You only need to do this once. This will reboot the system.

Volume Normalization
Different songs often have different volume. Enabling volume normalization will first run <i>ffmpeg</i> to compute the global volume of a song and automatically adjust player volume so that every song sounds equally loud.
